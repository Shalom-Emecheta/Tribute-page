            <p>I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and i will never forget him.</p>

            <h4>Steve Jobs</h4>
            <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email I've written, has been written by machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realise the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his visions, I've been able to realise my own. You'll be missed, Mr Jobs. Thank you for all your amazing work.</p>

            <h4>He's gone...</h4>
            <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I knew him. I will forever remember him. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.</p>

            <p>Dear Apple I was deeply sadened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs, the great leader and creator in the world. I believe he would go to a more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger Apple. We will remeber him for ever</p>
